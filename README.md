# Environments
## REP
### Run ubuntu docker
```
docker run -it --name rep -v /WORKING_DIRECTORY:/my_home ubuntu
```

### Install package inside docker container
```
apt-get update
apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### Run REP
We use the same version released by SABD authors: [fast-dbrd](https://github.com/irving-muller/fast-dbrd-modified). The code is under `REP` folder. Note: please run SABD data preprocessing first, as the data used by this approach is generated by `SABD`.

An example to run

```bash
./build/bin/fast-dbrd -n rep_mozilla_no_version -r ./ranknet-configs/full-textual-no-version.cfg --ts /YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/SABD/dataset/eclipse/timestamp_file.txt --time-constraint 365 --training-duplicates 922 --recommend /YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/SABD/dataset/eclipse/dbrd_test.txt
```

Notes:
Please check the issues under `fast-dbrd-modified` repo to understand what each argument means. Simply put:

1. `-n xxxx` means the name of the output file
2. `-r` choose the configurations
3. `--ts` timestamp file is generated by `SABD`, do link to there
4. `--time-constraint 365`, we use one-year time window
5. `--training-duplicates`, the number is the number of duplicate bug reports in the training data (including training and validation)
6. `--recommend xxx.dbrd_test.txt` is also generated by `SABD`

## SABD & Siamese Pairs
Create the environment from the `SABD/environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Run GloVe
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe glove
```

Install Make (can use the same docker as REP)

```bash
apt-get update & apt-get install cmake
```

Allow run and run `demo.sh` + the project name

```bash
chmod 777 demo.sh
./demo.sh eclipse
```

Download glove.42B.300d and unzip

```bash
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip
unzip glove.42B.300d.zip
```

## DC-CNN & HINDBR
Create the environment from the `HINDBR/hindbr.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f hindbr.yml
```

for HINDBR py2 environment

```bash
conda env create -f py27-env.yml
```

## Full-text Search
```bash
docker pull mysql

docker run --name dbrd-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=12345678 -d mysql
```
